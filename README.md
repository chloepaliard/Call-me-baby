# Call Me Baby

"Call Me Baby" is a visualization tool that was created to explore baby names through the last century. I created that tool with 4 friends in a limited amount of time. It was coded with D3, a JavaScript library and we designed it to respond to some precise usage cases. These cases are the following. The user can be a parent who wants to explore possibilities for his future child's name, or a random person who is curious about his/his relatives' name.

To use our tool, I would advise you to have python 2 or 3 running on your computer. Indeed, your browser may not support D3 in which case you will need to run a simple HTTP server locally.

To do so, on the local port 8080 for example :
Open your console, go to the project directory and write "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080" (python 2) or "python -m http.server 8080" (python 3).

Then just open your browser and go to the local page corresponding to the port you started the server on : "localhost:8080".

You can now play with the Call Me Baby vis tool !
